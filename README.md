I've been working as a Software Engineer since 2014, mainly developing web applications, component libraries and design systems. I've worked on medium to large projects in fintech and martech, mainly in multinational companies and scale-ups.

My daily work involves TypeScript, React and Node.js. I mix functional and reactive approaches to design and produce high-quality software that's easy to extend and test.
